## The Nutshell

Shopify, like pretty much every other hosted platform, has always had question marks around exactly how good a performance it is actually possible to achieve for a new site. Thankfully Shopify seem to have identified this issue as a key area for improvement - and are doing so on an ongoing basis from a server side perspective. 

But in a bid to help us help ourselves, Shopify have released a new tool - for inspecting the efficiency of the Liquid code within the frontend template files. This means it is now easier to analyse the quality of how the frontend has been built, rather than just whether it looks good.

## The Deepdive

To begin using this tool and exploring which aspects of the Liquid code could be improved, there are a few initial steps to setup:

*Prereqs. You must be using Chrome as your web browser, and have access to the Store Owner account of the Shopify Store you are looking to inspect.*


1. Start by installing the Chrome Extension called "Shopify Theme Inspector for Chrome" - here's a link <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shopify-theme-inspector-f/fndnankcflemoafdeboboehphmiijkgp>

2. Navigate to your Shopify Store within the Chrome browser. 

3. Click the new Shopify icon which should sit within your extensions, in the top right corner of the browser window. You'll be prompted to login to the Store in order to use this.

4. Open up Chrome Developer Tools (Right-click -> Inspect), and switch to the Shopify Tab which should now have been added. 

5. Refresh the page, or click through to a page that you think may have performance issues.

You should now see a beautiful 'Flame Graph' just like this...

Now based on that graph we can start to analyse which blocks of code are the most inefficient on the page. Do this
